Earthy tones like terracotta, olive green, and warm beige are making a strong comeback, creating spaces that feel grounded and inviting. Natural materials such as wood, stone, and rattan are also trending, adding texture and a sense of organic comfort. Open floor plans remain popular, but with clever zoning using rugs, lighting, and furniture placement to define different areas. Overall, it’s all about simplicity, balance, and comfort.",
//     para2: "Another key trend is the integration of smart technology and sustainable elements. From voice-activated lighting to eco-friendly furniture made from recycled materials, homeowners are making conscious choices that enhance both convenience and the environment. Modular sofas and multifunctional furniture are ideal for flexible living, especially in smaller urban spaces. Statement lighting, large art pieces, and indoor plants are also becoming must-have elements to bring personality into the living room. These 2025 trends perfectly balance form and function, blending style with a modern lifestyle.",
